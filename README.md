Collection of GAMMA modifications to end-tier weaponry

Currently out of date, feel free to fork and update, I will credit if you do.

Changes:
VSSK - Separated Ammo from ASH-12 and added new crafting recipe. Improved ballistic performance.

ISG Weapons;
Reworked existing GAMMA ISG issued weaponry (Anything described in-game as designed/issued to ISG) to be more "futuristic" and more plausible as over-engineered low-production number platforms designed to help ISG try to wreste back control of the zone.
    
    AKSU - Specialization CQB: Incredible fire rate and high magazine capacity, but very poor accuracy
    
    AK74 - Specialization Full Auto: Virutally zero recoil and high accuracy.
    
    AKM - Specialization Damage: Still shoots 7.62x39 but now hits like it's shooting .308
    
    RD-3x39 - Specialization Damage: Completely reworked from an awkard duckling DMR to a hybrid of an Abakan and a VAL. 
    
    AKC - Specialization Durability: Takes effectively no durability burn, even from extreme misuse. Good to offload onto companions or for extended away missions. 
    
    Saiga - Specialization Burst Fire: Added Abakan's two-shot feed code allowing you to put two rounds on target before recoil. Loses to RAPTR in mag capacity but massively higher TTK and flexibility.
